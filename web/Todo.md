# Todo list for the web part of the project

Feel free to add items to this list.
Depending on the size of the item consider opening an issue instead.
This is mainly here so I can track what to do easily so you don't have to use it but if you start working on something please write it down.

| Item | Description | Assignee | Done |
| :-- | :--------- | :------: | :--: |
| Split components | Split components into multiple smaller ones and make them as reusable as possible | Zach | [ ] |
| Write Doc | Write documentation for the part see [issue](https://github.com/ArmandBriere/Archy/issues/7) | | [ ] |
| Redo Firestore Queries | Firestore queries need to be rewritten and pagination needs to be implemented | | [ ] |
| Write global scss | A well done global scss would help a lot when creating or changing new pages | | [ ] |
